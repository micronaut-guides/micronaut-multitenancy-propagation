Multi-Tenancy, as it relates to software development, is when a single instance of an application is used to service multiple clients (tenants) in a way that each tenants' data is isolated from the other.

To use the Micronautâ€™s multitenancy capabilities you must have the multitenancy dependency on your classpath. For example in `build.gradle:`

[source,groovy]
.gateway/build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/gateway/build.gradle[tag=multitenancy,indent=0]
----

[source,yml]
.gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml
----
micronaut:
...

include::{sourceDir}/gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=multitenancy]

----

<1> Enable tenant propagation.
<2> Propagate the resolved tenant ID only in requests going to a particular set of services. In our example, we define a regex to match the service id `books`.
<3> In the gateway we use the https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/multitenancy/tenantresolver/CookieTenantResolver.html[CookieTenantResolver] which resolves the current tenant from an HTTP cookie.
<4> We propagate the tenant with a https://docs.micronaut.io/snapshot/api/io/micronaut/multitenancy/writer/HttpHeaderTenantWriter.html[HttpHeaderTenantWriter] which writes the current tenant to a HTTP Header.
